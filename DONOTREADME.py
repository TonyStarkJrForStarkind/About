Brief Profile of Tony Stark Jr
I am a big fan of Tony Stark and who plays it,RDJ. So "Tony Stark" is in honor of Iron Man and "Jr" is in honor of RDJ,which make
it less "agressive".And the organization name is the short form of "Stark Industries".I do not possess Tony's wealth and intelligence
while we share the same identity -- visionaries.
